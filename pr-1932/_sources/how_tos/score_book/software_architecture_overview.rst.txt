================================

S-Core software architecture is not set in stone. The following is the overview of the software architecture according to the current
state of the discussion:

There is a `software architecture community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/architecture-community>`_,
that is responsible for defining S-Core software architecture.

You can always propose a change to an existing architecture or propose a new functionality by creating a feature request.

You can find an overview of existing feature requests in the corresponding `Feature Requests / Modification <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/4/views/1>`_
GitHub project.

The process for issuing a feature request is documented in the :ref:`contribution guide <feature_request_guideline>`.

Software architecture community periodically organizes software architecture community workshops, which
can be joined personally (in case you need to present your feature request) or virtually (open for everyone).
This is the place where new approved feature requests and possible, potentially existing solutions, are discussed.
