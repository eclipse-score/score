Software Architecture Overview
================================

S-Core software architecture is not set in stone. There is a current overview of supposed software architecture, that
can be found here: (Link).

There is a software architecture community, that is responsible for defining s-core software architecture. You can always
propose a change to an existing architecture or propose a new functionality by creating a feature request.

You can find an overview of existing feature requests here: (TODO: link and screenshot with an overview)

The process for issuing a feature request is documented here: (TODO: link)

Software architecture community periodically organizes software architecture community workshops, which
can be joined personally (in case you need to present your feature request) or virtually (oopen for everyone).
This is the place where new approved feature requests are discussed.
