Sample application
===================

Let us imagine, you want to contribute to the S-Core project and provide a new platform module.
Or you want to build an application on top of S-Core. In both cases you will need to set up a repository,
to introduce a new bazel module and so on and so on. This tutorial will guide you through all necessary steps
based on the use-case, that we want to create a simple small demo application, called *scrample*, that uses some of the S-Core
platform modules to implement its functionality.
