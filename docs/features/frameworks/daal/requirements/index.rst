Open Issues
-----------

[Any points that are still being decided/discussed.]

   .. note::
       While a CR is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant further discussion.
       Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they are being thought about but do not have a concrete resolution.
       This helps make sure all issues required for the CR to be ready for consideration are complete and reduces people duplicating prior discussion.



Footnotes
---------

[A collection of footnotes cited in the CR, and a place to list non-inline hyperlink targets.]
