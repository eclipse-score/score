Coding Guidelines
=================

The Rust consortium has decided that there will be no official coding guidelines provided by the Rust consortium.
However, the Rust community has a set of guidelines that are widely accepted and used.
These guidelines can be found in the official Rust documentation and are recommended for all Rust projects.

`Safety Critical Rust Consortium <https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/tree/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/>`_

`Learn unsafe Rust <https://google.github.io/learn_unsafe_rust/>`_

`Rust language <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-unsafe-rust.html>`_

State of Rust Safety-Critical Tooling
#####################################

An actual state of Rust safety critical tooling can be found in the following document:

`Mission statement Rust safety critical tooling <https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/tooling/mission-statement.md>`_


Explanation of ARA Applications in Rust
#######################################

Autosar also shares a public availabe document that explains how to use Rust in ARA applications.

`Autosar Rust ARA applications <https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R24-11/AP/AUTOSAR_AP_EXP_ARARustApplications.pdf>`_

Conclusions for S-CORE
######################

During the S-CORE project, we will not enforce any coding guidelines for Rust.
However, we will follow the guidelines provided by the Rust community and the Rust consortium.
We will also follow the guidelines provided by the Rust Foundation and the Safety Critical Rust Consortium.
The adaption of these guidelines will be documented in the S-CORE project documentation.
