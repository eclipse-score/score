Abstract
========

This component request proposes the integration of a safe Utils library for common utility functions and algorithms.

Motivation and Rationale
========================

The Utils library shall provide safe and efficient implementations of common utility functions and algorithms.
The library shall enable developers to perform common tasks in a type-safe manner, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving code quality.
A Utils library with type-safe utility functions is needed in the S-CORE software platform due to the frequent use of such functions in various features and the need for reliable utility operations.
There are multiple use-cases like calculating string hashes, embedding binary data in string format or managing resource lifetimes.

Specification
=============

The following details and requirements describe the aspects of the current feature in the context of S-CORE.

General considerations
----------------------

The Utils library should provide type-safe utility functions and efficient algorithms:

* :need:`comp_req__utils__string_hash`
* :need:`comp_req__utils__base64`
* :need:`comp_req__utils__pimpl_ptr`
* :need:`comp_req__utils__scoped_operation`
* :need:`comp_req__utils__deterministic_behavior`

The component should be extensible in the future to support additional utility functions and algorithms as needed.
