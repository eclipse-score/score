GoogleTest (GTest) Verification Report
======================================

Introduction
------------
Scope and purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GoogleTest (GTest) is a C++ testing framework developed by Google to support the creation
of robust, maintainable, and portable tests. It is designed to help developers write tests
by offering a rich set of assertions, test fixtures, and test discovery
mechanisms. GTest is compatible with various platforms.

Inputs and outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Inputs: Software sources (C++), GTest-based test files (C++)
| Outputs: Test binary, Test report (txt, json, xml).

  GTest overview

Available information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Version: 1.15.0
- Official repository: https://github.com/google/googletest
- Official documentation: https://google.github.io/googletest
- API Reference: https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/testing.html
- Example of GTest configuration in S-CORE module repository: https://github.com/eclipse-score/baselibs/blob/main/MODULE.bazel


Installation and integration
----------------------------
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| To add the GTest Bazel dependency to your project or module, include the following line in your MODULE.bazel file:

.. code-block:: Python

  bazel_dep(name = "googletest", version = "1.15.0")

| Bazel will fetch from the Bazel Central Registry (BCR): https://registry.bazel.build/modules/googletest


Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Integrated in bazel.

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires C++ compiler and bazel build environment.

Safety evaluation

Result
~~~~~~
GTest requires qualification for use in safety-related software development according to ISO 26262.


**Tool Qualification**
-------------------------------------------
Based on method: validation of the software tool.

Requirements and testing aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tool requirements are derived from official documentation: https://google.github.io/googletest

GTest is an open-source tool and does not provide formal, vendor-defined requirements.
Therefore, the testing team is responsible for identifying the specific GTest functionality
used in the project. Based on this, requirements for the utilized features must be derived from
the available documentation and GTest validated against defined requirements.
