DR-008-Infra: Docs Modularity
================================================================

.. dec_rec:: Modularize docs
   :id: dec_rec__infra__docs_modularity
   :status: proposed
   :context: Infrastructure
   :decision: tbd

Context / Problem
-----------------

There is a proof-of-concept for an alternative documentation build concept introduced in
`tooling PR 95 <https://github.com/eclipse-score/tooling/pull/95>`_.
It improves the modularity of documentation but drops features of the existing documentation concept.

Goals and Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Implementation Effort**: Don't spend much one-time effort to implement the change proposed here.
- **Maintenance Effort**: Don't spend much ongoing effort due to increased complexity.
- **Ease of use**: Developers don't like working on documentation, so we should make it easy on them.

Options Considered
------------------

Option S: Single docs() only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We keep the current docs-as-code concept and drop the PoC proposal.

Implementation Effort 💚 No additional effort.

Maintenance Effort 🤔 unclear in relation to PoC.

Ease of use 💚 No change for developers.

Option M: Many Bazel targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We drop the current approach and switch to the PoC approach.

Implementation Effort 😡 Requires restructuring all documentation.

Maintenance Effort 🤔 unclear

Ease of use 😡 Requires developers to adapt to new workflow. No VSCode LSP integration.

Option C: Combine the Best of Both
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We integrated the advantages of the PoC into the existing solution maintaining all benefits.

Implementation Effort 😡 Certainly the most effort

Maintenance Effort 😡 Certainly the most effort

Ease of use 💚 No mandatory change for developers at first but extensions?

Evaluation
----------

Here is the summary, how well each option achieves the goals in order of goal importance:

   Implementation Effort,      💚, 😡, 😡
   Maintenance Effort,         🤔, 🤔, 😡
   Ease of use,                💚, 😡, 💚

**Decision:** Option S has no downsides while the alternatives do.
