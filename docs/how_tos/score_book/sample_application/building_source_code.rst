Building source code
=====================

Now, as we've provided the documentation for our component, it is time to add some code as shown in the following commit (TODO: Link to commit).

Let us go through the most important parts of it and start with bazel `src/BUILD <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/src/BUILD>`_
file.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    cc_binary(
        name = "scrample",
        srcs = [
            "assert_handler.cpp",
            "assert_handler.h",
            "main.cpp",
        ],
        visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
        deps = [
            ":sample_sender_receiver",
            "@communication//score/mw/com",
            "@boost.program_options",
            "@score-baselibs//score/language/futurecpp",
            "@score-baselibs//score/mw/log",
        ],
    )


`cc_binary  <https://bazel.build/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_binary>`_ produces a cpp binary, by starting C/C++ compilation with the specified toolchain.
We will talk about defining and specifying the toolchain later in this chapter. Let us first have a look at the content of the *cc_binary*.

*cc_binary* attributes are very well described in the bazel documentation and it is definitely makes sense to check them out.
In our case, the rule has three source files that we want to compile. Additionally, our *scrample* binary depends on the *communication* module
for the ipc functionality and on the *baselibs* module for cpp language extension and logging functionality.
We can also see, that *cc_binary* for scrample has the "public" visibility.
That's because we want to use it later in the *reference integration* module.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    cc_library(
        name = "sample_sender_receiver",
        srcs = [
            "sample_sender_receiver.cpp",
        ],
        hdrs = [
            "sample_sender_receiver.h",
        ],
        deps = [
            ":datatype",
            "@communication//score/mw/com",
            "@score-baselibs//score/mw/log",
        ],
    )

    cc_library(
        name = "datatype",
        srcs = [
            "datatype.cpp",
        ],
        hdrs = [
            "datatype.h",
        ],
        deps = [
            "@communication//score/mw/com",
            "@score-baselibs//score/language/futurecpp",
        ],
    )

Additionally, there is also a sender/receiver and a datatype  `cc_library  <https://bazel.build/reference/be/c-cpp#cc_library>`_,
separated in standalone libraries for a better testability. Scrample *cc_binary* rule depends on them as well.

Now, as we've defined the targets, it would be time to build the binary. For this, we need first to specify the toolchain,
that should be used for building our binary and that will call compiler and linker at the end. We aim to run our application in QNX qemu
environment, therefore we should compile our application with qcc toolchain.

Before we continue, it is important to mention two fundamental concepts in bazel,
`bazel toolchains  <https://bazel.build/extending/toolchains>`_ and `bazel platforms  <https://bazel.build/extending/platforms>`_.
Explanation of these concepts goes beyond this small tutorial. But to move further it is important to give a brief explanation
of what these concepts are about.

*Bazel toolchain* specifies, at least in our case, which compiler toolchain we are using to compile and to link our code. It could be
qcc, gcc or llvm toolchain.

*Bazel platform* specifies for which cpu architecture the toolchain should build the binary, e.g. arm or x86.

For our small scrample example we plan to build with qcc toolchain for x86_64 platform.

To add qcc toolchain support to our module, we need first to extend our
`MODULE.bazel <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/MODULE.bazel>`_ file with the toolchain information.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # Configure the target toolchain.
    bazel_dep(name = "score_toolchains_qnx", version = "0.0.2", dev_dependency=True)
    qnx = use_extension("@score_toolchains_qnx//:extensions.bzl", "toolchains_qnx", dev_dependency=True)
    qnx.sdp(
        sha256 = "f2e0cb21c6baddbcb65f6a70610ce498e7685de8ea2e0f1648f01b327f6bac63",
        strip_prefix = "installation",
        url = "https://www.qnx.com/download/download/79858/installation.tgz",
    )
    use_repo(qnx, "toolchains_qnx_sdp")
    use_repo(qnx, "toolchains_qnx_qcc")

As you can see, we reference here the *score_toolchains_qnx* module, as dependency. It contains qnx toolchain including compiler, linker, image
creation tools and their configuration for the s-core project.

TODO: can Niko provide more description on what is happening here?

.. tip::
    CI/CD pipeline uses its own QNX license for building the code with qnx. If you want to build the source code with
    qnx compiler locally, you will need to acquire a QNX 8.x "free for non commercial use" license and install QNX 8.x SDP
    as described in the `QNX & QEMU set-up tutorial <https://github.com/eclipse-score/reference_integration/tree/main/qnx_qemu>`_.

As our application depends on *baselibs* and *communication* module, as described in the
`src/BUILD <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/src/BUILD>`_ file, we need to add
the dependencies to that modules into the `MODULE.bazel <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/MODULE.bazel>`_ file 
as well, as shown below:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    bazel_dep(name = "score-baselibs", version = "0.1.1")

    bazel_dep(name = "communication", version = "0.1.1")

Till now we've just said, that our module depends on another bazel module that defines qcc toolchain. Now
we want to start using this toolchain in our module and therefore need to specify the platform and
configure the usage of qcc toolchain in `.bazelrc <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/.bazelrc>`_ file.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 13

In lines 1-6 we define compiler options, that are related to the code itself, and therefore should be used
during the compilation of our source code by all toolchains. It is important to understand, that bazel modules we
depend on, get built in the context of our bazel module configuration, and therefore we also need to specify the compiler settings
that are necessary to build bazel modules we depend on as well.

Further in line 8 we say, that we take over the common configuration also for the qnx toolchain. Afterwards we specify
compiler and linker flags, that are relevant for the qnx toolchain only.

In line 13, that is also highlighted in the code snippet, we finally say, that we want to use *qnx toolchain*, that we've previously
referenced in the `MODULE.bazel <https://github.com/eclipse-score/scrample/blob/main/MODULE.bazel>`_ file
and want to build our code for the *x86_64-qnx platform*. This is important, as our qnx toolchain provides support for multiple platforms,
e.g. *arm* and *x86_64*.

Finally, we can compile our code. We need to specify explicitly which config should be used during the compilation,
as shown in the example:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    bazel build --config=x86_64-qnx  //src:scrample

After the successfull compilation the binary can be normally found in the build folder:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    Target //src:scrample up-to-date:
        bazel-bin/src/scrample

Now it is time to run the binary in the reference QNX QEMU image.
