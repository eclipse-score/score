   This document describes the general guidances for quality management based on the concept which is defined :need:`doc_concept__quality__process`.

General Hints
=============

Workflow for quality management is shown in :numref:`quality_workflow_fig` to get an overview.
The following steps are required to ensure the quality in the project:

#. Create/maintain Quality Management Plan
   For the creation of the Quality Management Plan, the template :need:`gd_temp__qlm_plan` can be used. As a reference also the 
   Platform Quality Management Plan :need:`doc__platform_quality_plan` can be considered. Derivations to the platform plan should 
   be documented in the Quality Management Plan. Also the project individual definitions like used resources and milestones.

#. Quality Plan (released)
   The Quality Management Plan is created and maintained by the :need:`rl__quality_manager`. It shall be continuously maintained
   during the project.

#. Verify/Aprove Platform Release
   The verification of a platform releas is done by the :need:`rl__technical_lead` and supported by the :need:`rl__quality_manager`.
   A checklist is used to ensure that all required items are checked. The checklist is based on the :need:`gd_chklst__review_checklist`.
   Every Platform Release needs at least one process audit.

#. Execute Platform Process Audit
   The results of the process audit are documented in the :need:`wp__process_impr_report`. For the release 100% of the audit has to be done.

#. Execute Feature Process Compliance Checks
   For the feature process compliance checks the :need:`gd_chklst__review_checklist` is used. Also spot checks shall be done to ensure that 
   the processes are followed.

#. Execute Feature Work Product Reviews
   For the work product reviews the :need:`gd_chklst__review_checklist` is used. Derivations shall be documented in the issue tracking system with
   the label "q_wp_review" as described in the :need:`gd_guidl__wp_review`.

#. Monitor/Improve Quality Activities
   The issues for the improvment shall describe the scope, estimation of impact and time, measures as defined in :need:`wp__process_impr_report`.
   With the issue tracking system the status of the issues can be monitored. The issues are assigned to the :need:`rl__quality_manager`.

#. Update Issue Tracking System
   The actual status of the issues is updated in the issue tracking system. If necessary the :need:`rl__quality_manager` has to escalate the 
   issues to the :need:`rl__project_lead`.
