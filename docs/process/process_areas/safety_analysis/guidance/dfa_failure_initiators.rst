DFA failure initiators

  :id: gd_guidl__dfa_failure_initiators
  :status: valid
  :complies: std_wp__iso26262__software_751, std_wp__iso26262__software_753


:note: Use the failure initiators to ensure a structed analysis. If a fault model doesn't apply, please fill in a short desciption in the
       violation cause so it could be recognized that the analysis is done. If there are additional failure initiators needed, please
       enlage the list of fault models.

    **Purpose**

    In order to identify all cascading and common cause failures, which may initiated from your feature or components to the platform, other features, components, etc.,
    use the following framework of dependent failure initiators to check your completeness of the analysis.

    **DFA failure initiators**

    | 2.2 Communication between the two elements:
    | Receiving function is affected by information that is false, lost, sent multiple times, or in the wrong order etc. from the sender.

    |     In that respect, the dependent failure initiators Unintended Impact and Communication represent causes of violation of freedom from interference for software.

    | 2.3 Shared information inputs
    | Same information consumed by the two functions even in absence of shared resources, i.e. from a functional perspective.
