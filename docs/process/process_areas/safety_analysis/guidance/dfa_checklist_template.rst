DFA Checklist
=============

.. gd_chklst:: DFA Checklist
    :id: gd_chklst__dfa
    :status: valid
    :tags: safety analysis

    **Purpose**

    In order to identify all cascading and common cause failures, which may initiated from your feature or components to the platform, other features, components, etc.,
    use the following framework of dependent failure initiators to check your completeness of the analysis.

    **Checklist**

    | 2.1 Shared resources
    | Same software element instance used by the two functions which are therefore affected by the failure or unavailability of that shared resource.

    | (*) These issues are taken from the arguments on freedom from interference between software elements.
    |     In that respect, the dependent failure initiators Unintended Impact and Communication represent causes of violation of freedom from interference for software.

    | 2.5 Systematic coupling
    | Systematic causes from human or tool errors can lead to the simultaneous failure of more than one function.
