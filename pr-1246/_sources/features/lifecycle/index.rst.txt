Feature flag
------------

To activate this feature, use the following feature flag:

``experimental_lifecycle``


Abstract
--------

The lifecycle feature provides a set of functionalities to manage the lifecycle of 
components in the S-SCORE platform. The goal is to ensure that components can be 
started, stopped, and monitored effectively, providing a robust framework for managing the state of the system.

Motivation
----------

For every ecu handling of startup, shutdown, and monitoring of components is crucial to 
ensure the system operates correctly and efficiently. Additionally we need do provide the 
means to set the system in different operating modes, such as normal operation, engineering/debug mode, 
flash mode etc.


Rationale
---------

Main task of the lifecycle system is to start and stop processes depending on the overall state the 
user wants to achieve 
and the functional dependencies between the processes. 

We call a state of the system an `operating mode`, which is defined via the processes running on the 
system at a certain point in time.

Examples for operating modes are `startup`, `running`, `shutdown` etc.

Via the configuration we define a certain operting mode and add all the components, which are needed to 
realize this operating mode as dependencies. 

A `lifecycle component` is a configuration unit, which describes the `executable`, which shall be executed 
and the `sandbox` the platform has to provide to run this executable. 
E.g. the `sandbox`` shall describe 

- environment variables, which shall be set via the lifecycle system
- secpol policies on QNX, which shall be applied to the process
- cgroup configurations on linux, which shall be applied to the process
- user and group ids under which the process shall be started.
- ...

A second task of the lifecycle system is to supervise the aliveness of the processes, which are started 
and to initiate appropriate actions in case of a failure, which might result in many cases in 
a change of the operting mode.

The overall concept is based on 2 components: 

* Component Launch Manager: Responsible for starting and stopping components based on the defined operating modes
  and alive supervision of the started components
* Component Health Monitor: Provides process local monitoring fucntionalities 
  such as deadline monitoring and logical program flow monitoring.
