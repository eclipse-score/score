SW Platform Assumptions
=======================

.. document:: SW Platform Assumptions
   :id: doc__platform_assumptions
   :status: draft
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :realizes: PROCESS_wp__platform_sw_aou

Assumptions on Environment
--------------------------

In this section assumptions are described which need to be fulfilled by the architecture level below the SW platform,
i.e. by the elements outside of S-CORE, but used by S-CORE platform components. These include elements like
the operating system, programming language libraries, hypervisor or processing hardware.

To fulfill these assumptions is the responsibility of the integrator.

Assumptions on the OS integration - Community Level
---------------------------------------------------

This is the lowest level of integration, the higher levels will build on this.
It also contains expectations towards an OS supplier which can be used as criteria for OS selection
by the integrator. Building and running of OS is enabled, but no pro-active support from S-CORE
is provided for e.g. build or test problems. No guarantees that S-CORE builds or runs on the OS.

.. aou_req:: OS integration assistance
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_integration_assistance
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide a contact point for integration assistance.

.. aou_req:: OS integration manual
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_integration_manual
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide an integration manual.

.. aou_req:: OS bug interface
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_bug_interface
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide a bug reporting interface.

   Note: There is no guarantee provided to fix these bugs.

There are no AoUs on the S-CORE SW Platform integrator with respect to OS integration on this level,
as this level is not expected sufficient for a product release, only for incubation/prototype.

Assumptions on the OS integration - Functional Level
----------------------------------------------------

This is the middle level of integraton, the higher level will build on this.
It is the level where the S-CORE SW platform will functionally "work" on the supplied OS.

.. aou_req:: OS bazel tooling
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_bazel_tooling
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide tools for Bazel to be able to build the S-CORE SW platform on the supplier OS
   and support the run and test of the S-CORE SW platform on the supplier OS.

.. aou_req:: OS bug fixing
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_bug_fixing
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall fix bugs reported in a predictable manner.

   Note: For OSS community providing an OS this requirement could be covered by analyzing how bugs were treated in the past. For companies by the definition of a service level process.

.. aou_req:: SW platform testing
   :id: aou_req__platform__testing
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The integrator shall run the tests provided by S-CORE (platform, feature, component and Unit level for his selected S-CORE modules) on his selected OS/Hypervisor/HW combination,
   or provide equivalent argumentation.

   Note1: S-CORE will run these tests for one or more reference OS/Hypervisor/HW combination, if not all passing, remaining issues are documented in release notes.
         In case the selected combination is equal to a S-CORE reference, this AoU may be skipped.

   Note2: Equivalent argumentation could be for example that the test environments for unit tests would be sufficiently equal in S-CORE project and at the integrator.

.. aou_req:: SW platform integration bug reporting
   :id: aou_req__platform__bug_report
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: QM
   :status: valid

   The integrator shall report the bugs found during integration of the S-CORE SW Platform on his selected OS/Hypervisor/HW combination to the OS supplier and S-CORE for analysis.

Assumptions on the OS integration - Certifiable Level
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the highest level of integraton. This is the level where the S-CORE SW platform will be certifiable on the supplied OS.

.. aou_req:: OS integration levels
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_levels
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier and integrator shall provide all the levels AoUs in a safe way (i.e. the "safety" attribute will be raised to the level in this AoU).

   Note: This includes for example :need:`aou_req__platform__os_bazel_tooling`, :need:`aou_req__platform__os_bug_fixing`

.. aou_req:: OS safety AoU
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_safety_aou
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide Assumptions of (safe) Use.

   Note: This may be part of an OS safety manual.

.. aou_req:: OS safety functions
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_safety_functions
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall provide a list of safe OS functions.

.. aou_req:: OS safety anomaly reporting
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_safety_anomaly
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The OS supplier shall perform safety anomaly reporting.

   Note: This could be fulfilled by listing per release version all known and user reported bugs which affect the safe OS functions.

.. aou_req:: OS safety matching
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_safety_matching
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The Integrator shall integrate the SW platform with an OS providing safety functions, if the system using the SW platform has safety goals.
   This includes to make sure the OS safety functions S-CORE SW platform requires matches with the OS provided ones (as in :need:`aou_req__platform__os_safety_functions`).

   Note1: A list of OS safety functions needed is compiled by the S-CORE project here (TBD).

   Note2: The integrator can expect that for the safe S-CORE reference OS this AoU is fulfilled by S-CORE SW Platform already.

.. aou_req:: OS safety integration
   :id: aou_req__platform__os_safety_integration
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The Integrator shall make sure that the AoUs relevant for OS safety functions (as in :need:`aou_req__platform__os_safety_aou`) are fulfilled by the S-CORE SW platform.

   Note1: This could be done by contributing the required updates to the S-CORE project.

   Note2: The integrator can expect that for the safe S-CORE reference OS this AoU is fulfilled by S-CORE SW Platform already.

.. aou_req:: Integrator safety anomaly reporting
   :id: aou_req__platform__integration_safety_anomaly
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The integrator shall perform safety anomaly reporting taking into account also the reporting of all the components (incl. the OS) he integrates.

   Note: S-CORE supports this, but can only be active triggered by the integrator or based on OS anomaly reports which are available Open Source.

Assumptions of Use
------------------

In this section assumptions are described which need to be fulfilled by the applications running on top of the SW platform.

.. aou_req:: Integrator safety aou
   :id: aou_req__platform__safety_aou
   :reqtype: Non-Functional
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: valid

   The integrator shall describe in his safety manual (or similar document) the AoUs which need to be covered by the user (applications) for all the components (incl. the OS)  he integrates.

   Note: For the safe S-CORE reference OS the integrator can take over AoUs from S-CORE safety manual (based on "assumed" need of safe OS functions).

TBD: more detailed functional AoUs
