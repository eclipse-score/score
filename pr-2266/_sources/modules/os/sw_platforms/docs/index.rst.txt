Software Platforms
##################

A Software Platform is an operating system environment on which Eclipse S-CORE is integrated and executed.
It provides the foundational services and interfaces required for S-CORE modules to function.

.. note::
   Software Platforms are categorized into *Tiers* based on their stability, support level, and intended use cases.
   Hence, they must meet requirements of their respective Tier.
   For details on this approach, and the requirements for each Tier, see :ref:`platform_assumptions`.
