# DR-003-Infra: Integration Testing in a Distributed Monolith - Extension for Non-CI Components

* **Status**: Submitted for Review
* **Owners**: Infrastructure Community
* **Date**: 2025-09-25
* **Supersedes / Extends**: Builds on the integration approach of [DR-002](./DR-002-infra.md)

---

## 1. Context / Problem Statement

[DR-002](./DR-002-infra.md) established that S-CORE applies strict
[Continuous Integration (CI)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html):
every change to any component must pass integration tests before merge.

Two gaps were not considered:
1. Some components are external (no direct control over their workflow cadence or branching model).
2. Some internal components are temporarily not operating with per-change pull requests (e.g. early incubation).

We still need fast, reliable integration feedback across the composed system ("distributed monolith") without freezing progress or leaving pipelines permanently red.

The challenge: How do we extend the CI discipline to components that cannot (yet) provide pre-merge integration signals, while minimizing friction, avoiding long-lived breakages, and keeping a path to full CI?

---

## 2. Decision

Introduce a **tiered integration model** defined by when a component receives system-level integration feedback relative to its change lifecycle.

We formalize three tiers (ordered by desirability):

| Tier | When Integration Tests Run (relative to component change) | Primary Use Case | CI Gate Effect | Target State |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Pre-merge (per PR) | Fully CI-enabled internal (and some external) components | Blocks merge on failure | Default & permanent |
| 2 | Post-merge (continuous against main branch) | Transitional internal components, external components which operate without PRs | Blocks promotion / release tags; failures trigger rollback or hotfix | Temporary on path to Tier 1 |
| 3 | Pre-integration of released artifact (version bump PR in S-CORE) | External components with independent release cadence | Blocks adoption of new version into registry | Accepted only for external components, and only if Tier 1/2 infeasible |

All **internal** components must plan migration to Tier 1. Tier 2 is explicitly transitional.

All **external** components can fall under any tier, depending on how closely they cooperate with S-CORE.

---

## 3. Detailed Tier Definitions

### Tier 1 (Pre-merge CI)
Characteristics:
* Every PR triggers integration validation as per DR-002.
* Failures block merge; must be resolved before proceeding.
* May include external repos that are willing to adopt our CI contract (webhooks, shared pipeline, or mirrored gated PR flow). For externals, feedback can be non-blocking if they prefer (e.g. advisory only).

### Tier 2 (Post-merge CI on Main)
Rationale / when allowed:
* Temporary: tooling or refactoring still pending; legacy systems lacking PR granularity.
Behavior:
* Integration suite runs on latest main (e.g. scheduled, or on each merge event via polling/mirroring).
* Failures block further release tagging or dependency promotion; owning team must react with highest priority.
* Participates in the "known-good" process of DR-002: if red, S-CORE cannot consume new versions until resolved.
* Migration plan required: target date for Tier 1, gaps to close, risk assessment if delayed.

### Tier 3 (Pre-integration CI on Released Artifacts)
Rationale:
* Upstream project cadence or governance prevents earlier visibility.
* We cannot enforce their branching/PR discipline.
* No strict up-to-dateness required â€” otherwise Tier 2 should be preferred.
Behavior:
* New upstream versions are proposed via an update PR (version bump) in S-CORE.
* Full integration tests run before the bump merges.
* If failing: we either (a) defer update, (b) contribute a fix upstream, or (c) add a compatibility shim internally.

## 4. Handling Breaking Changes

Breaking interface changes are only allowed when **all impacted Tier 1 components** have green adaptation PRs.

In addition, a mitigation plan for Tier 2 and 3 must exist (included in a shim layer, compatibility facade, or dual-version period).
Since no real synchronization with Tier 2 is possible, close collaboration with owning teams is required to ensure they can adapt promptly.

If not feasible, the change is postponed or introduced behind an opt-in feature flag with a deprecation timeline.

---

## 5. Alternatives Considered

1. Accept broken integration during coordinated waves of change.
   * Rejected: Encourages long red periods; compounds unrelated failures; extremely costly reintegration.
2. Separate, isolated integration pipelines per tier.
   * Rejected: Splits focus, increases maintenance, hides systemic readiness.
3. Force immediate universal Tier 1 adoption.
   * Rejected: Not reasonable due to external ecosystems.
4. Abandon strict CI for the entire system.
   * Rejected: Increases risk of production incidents, violates modern software engineering practices.

---

## 6. Consequences

**Positive:**
* S-CORE sticks to its CI principles while accommodating real-world constraints.
* Predictable system stability; controlled ingestion of third-party updates.
* Transparent technical debt ledger (list of non-Tier 1 components).
* Encourages upstream collaboration (move externals toward Tier 1 where possible).

**Negative:**
* Additional classification + reporting overhead.
* Tier 3 introduces release-based integration, with all its shortcomings like longer feedback loops and risk of surprise integration failures.
* Requires disciplined ownership to avoid Tier 2 stagnation.
